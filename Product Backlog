Single Player Mode: The objective of the game is to help Kanye West raise $53 billion and to save “Pablo”.

They can they reinvest their money into power-ups and items that can increase their clicking speed and passive income rate. 
This gametype is based on existing popular games such as http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/. 
Users will attempt to reach the target number in the quickest amount of time and can view a global/friend leaderboard. 

Multi-PLayer Mode: Users can compete against random opponents online or their own friends. Multi-player mode is has a few additional
features compared to single player mode. Most importantly players can use their money to either buy powerups or send debuffs to 
their opponents. We plan to keep multi-player limited to 2 people only.
